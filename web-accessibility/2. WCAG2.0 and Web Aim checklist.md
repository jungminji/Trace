# WCAG

- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0



WCAG is organized around four core principles: POUR

1. Perceivable
   - Making sure users can perceive content
   - Because something is perceivable with one sense such as sight, that doesn't mean that all users can perceive it
2. Operable
   - Can users use UI components and navigate the content
     - For example, something which requires a hover interaction cannot be operated by someone who can't use a mouse or is using a touchscreen
3. Understandable
4. Robust
   - The content to be consumed by a wide variety of user agents
