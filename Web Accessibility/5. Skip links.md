- On most websites the main content is usually not the first thing in the DOM, instead we often begin with navigation, sublists, sidebars, hamburger menus, and other bits of page scaffolding.
- Ths means that keyboard and screen reader users must first navigate through all of this content before they can get at the actual heart of the page.
